        <h1>Her name is <strong>Shreeee</strong></h1>
        <p>In the journey of life we meet remarkable people who leave their mark on our hearts.
            Like wise i first met her at college, a girl with her earphones and short hair.
            This 3 years of degree life was all about creating memories with her,
            going through up's and down's and tears and laughs.
            According to her we never judge we just discuss and that eventually turns out to be our gossip.
            I never expected this Crazy and chaotic girl to be my best friend.
            For me she isn't just a friend, she's a constant source of warmth, laughter and support making even the ordinary moments feel special.
            She's my <strong>confidence</strong>, my <strong>cheerleader</strong> and a part of my <strong>choosen family</strong>.
            <h3>--She is <strong>Chaos</strong> to my <strong>Calm</strong>.</h3></p>
